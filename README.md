TODO:

1. Exception Handling: Done
2. Write about bean validation importance on incoming POJO
3. Think about API urls from application properties
4. I was confused between description tag and extract
5. CoverArt API provides direct re-route to the image by using /front and /back as param, So there not really a need to

7. Need to implement concept of correlation id : Done
8. A note on Caching: Done and Caching as well
